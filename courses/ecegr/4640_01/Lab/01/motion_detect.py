Motion Detection Script for Enviro pHAT

This is a placeholder script for implementing motion detection using the Enviro pHAT's
accelerometer sensor. The accelerometer can detect changes in orientation and movement.

Potential implementations:
    - Detect when the device is moved or shaken
    - Trigger actions based on tilt or orientation changes
    - Log motion events to ThingSpeak
    - Create alerts when motion exceeds a threshold

Requirements:
    - envirophat library
    - python-dotenv library (if using ThingSpeak integration)

Example implementation ideas:
    1. Shake detector: Calculate acceleration magnitude and detect rapid changes
    2. Tilt sensor: Monitor x, y, z values to detect orientation
    3. Step counter: Detect periodic motion patterns
    4. Drop detector: Detect sudden acceleration changes
