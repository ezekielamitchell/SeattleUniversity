# Security and Documentation Update Summary

## Overview
This update addresses the security concern of hardcoded API keys in the repository and adds comprehensive documentation throughout the codebase.

## Security Changes

### API Keys Removed
The following hardcoded ThingSpeak API keys have been removed from the codebase:
- `temperature.py`: Removed key "TJ2D3LRDO4A4BEVO"
- `all.py`: Removed key "YZS13Z5HLRLHSLP7"

### New Security Implementation
All scripts now use environment variables to load API keys:
1. **Environment Variable Loading**: Scripts use `python-dotenv` to load API keys from `.env` files
2. **Validation**: Scripts validate that API keys are present before running
3. **Git Protection**: `.gitignore` prevents `.env` files from being committed to version control

### Setup Required
Users must now:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the Lab/01 directory
2. Add their personal ThingSpeak API key to the `.env` file
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Documentation Added

### File-Level Documentation
All Python files now include:
- Comprehensive module docstrings explaining purpose and functionality
- Requirements and dependencies
- Setup instructions
- Author attribution

### Inline Documentation
Enhanced code with:
- Comments explaining the purpose of each code section
- Variable descriptions
- Clear explanations of timing and sensor configurations

### Supporting Documentation
Created new documentation files:
- **README.md**: Complete guide for Lab 01 with setup instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies for easy installation
- **.env.example**: Template file showing required environment variables

## Files Modified
1. `temperature.py` - Updated to use environment variables, added documentation
2. `all.py` - Updated to use environment variables, added documentation
3. `motion_detect.py` - Added placeholder documentation

## Files Created
1. `.gitignore` - Prevents sensitive files from being committed
2. `courses/ecegr/4640_01/Lab/01/.env.example` - Template for environment variables
3. `courses/ecegr/4640_01/Lab/01/README.md` - Comprehensive lab documentation
4. `courses/ecegr/4640_01/Lab/01/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Benefits

### Security
- ✅ API keys are no longer publicly visible in the repository
- ✅ Each user maintains their own private API keys
- ✅ Reduced risk of API key abuse or quota exhaustion
- ✅ Follows security best practices for credential management

### Documentation
- ✅ Clear setup instructions for new users
- ✅ Comprehensive inline comments for code understanding
- ✅ Professional-quality module documentation
- ✅ Easy-to-follow troubleshooting guide

### Maintainability
- ✅ Standard approach using .env files
- ✅ Easy dependency management with requirements.txt
- ✅ Clear separation of code and configuration
- ✅ Better onboarding experience for new developers

## Next Steps for Users

To use the updated scripts:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd courses/ecegr/4640_01/Lab/01
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure API key**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your ThingSpeak API key
   ```

3. **Run scripts**:
   ```bash
   python temperature.py
   # or
   python all.py
   ```

## Important Notes

- The `.env` file is automatically ignored by git and will never be committed
- Each developer/user needs their own `.env` file with their personal API keys
- The old hardcoded API keys in git history are still visible - consider revoking them in ThingSpeak and generating new ones
- Always keep your `.env` file private and never share it publicly
